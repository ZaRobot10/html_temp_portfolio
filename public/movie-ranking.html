<h1>Movies recommendation by Ekankaar</h1>

<h2> Top 3 movies released recently</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Everything Everywhere All At Once</h3>
<p>
This movie solos the enitre marvel phase 4. <br />
One of the best movies involving mulitverses.<br />
Characters have depth and the movie is a lot of fun.
</p>

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>
A very well potrayed movie, with brilliant audio-visual effects.<br />
Regular involvement of famous scientists made it exiciting as we had studied them in class
</p>

<h3>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>
A stylized animated film, which looks amazing and a lot of fun to watch.<br />
It has an amazing new cast of Characters and the Villian and the Spiderman are both trying to do the right thing in their perspective which is the opposite of what they want, so it leads to an interesting clash between them. <br/>
Inclusion of an Indian spiderman was nice.
